# Coding Challenge

Here is a sample project that will give us some insight into your current level of experience.

This is a simple project, but organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production. Write your README as if it was for a production service, and include the following items:

* Reasoning behind your technical choices
* Trade-offs you might have made, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project

## Functional spec

TODO

## Technical spec

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with -- feel free to use any of them to complete the coding challenge:

* Ruby (our web backend is written in Ruby)
* Java (our trade execution code is written in Java)
* JavaScript (our web frontend uses JavaScript)

## How we review

The aspects of your code we will judge include:

* Functionality: Does the application do what was asked?
* Code quality: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
* Testing: How thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change?
* Technical choices: Do choices of libraries, frameworks, etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
